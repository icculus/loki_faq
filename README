For reference, YES. faq.php3 is the same in both the public and private
dirs. So is index_search.php3.

The difference in functionality is that the links to actually modify the
FAQs, add them, whatever, are generated with a function "catModifyRemove",
which is deliberately stubbed in the public one.

The actual php for maintenance also doesn't exist in the public one.

Index_search.php3 really is the same. It search the FAQs, and returns
links. It's up to faq.php3 to either provide an admin interface, or not.

What you're looking at is a complete re-write of the loki_faq engine.

It's had many and varying enhancements, including the fact it's now a
damn site easier to use, has persistent database connections [yes, Ryan,
they're carefully controlled], is far more secure [the user only needs
SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE privs; not CREATE or DROP], the libraries
are unified, the presentation and logic have mostly been separated,
and a whole list of other things.

This is a system designed for managing and presenting on the web a group
of Frequently Asked Questions or FAQs.  Especially if the FAQs are about
software products.

It was implemented at Loki Software, Inc. initially by Raf Barrero,
and lived as faqs.lokigames.com.

It is being released publicly for the usual reasons and specifically to
foster ad-hoc support for the Loki products from the community of users
and enthusiasts.
