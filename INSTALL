the usual stuff with a linux/apache/mysql/php app

create a database called faqs (or a different name and edit the lib.php3 files).

if you're smart, you'll create a separate user for this database with a nice password and a bunch of neato permissions that allow that user to e.g. insert and create tables etc.  don't forget the creating of tables.

certainly edit the lib.php3 files to reflect the user/pass pair you've chosen.

mysql -u user -p faqs < mysql/samplefaqs.sql  

stick the loki_faq_public somewhere you want the publish the faqs, the loki_faq_private somewhere password protected or something.

searching should be broken due to its dependence on a working htdit system

notes:

it's a bit wierd, how the schema was designed here... wouldn't call it first normal form or whatever.

bugs:

lots of them
